## Golox
This is a Go implementation of Lox, a toy programming language. This program consists of a lexer, a parser, and an interpreter. The interpreter recursively evaluates nodes of the AST generated by the parser. 

#### Setup

If you want to try this interpreter for yourself, you can
- Clone the repo
- Make sure you have Go installed, latest version should work fine
- Run `go build`
- `./golox` for the REPL, `./golox [source]` to run a source file.
